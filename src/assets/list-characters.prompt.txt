As an AI assistant specializing in literary analysis, your task is to identify all the characters that appear in a text I will provide to you.

The text will be in CSV format, where:
- The first column is the line index
- The second column contains the actual text content

For each unique character you identify, please provide the following information:
- The character’s name (or ‘narration’ if not a character)
- The character’s gender (‘male’, ‘female’, or ‘NA’ for narration)
- A list of all aliases used to refer to this character in the text

Organize your response as a JSON object in the following format:
{
    "data": [
        {
            "character": "character’s name or ‘narration’",
            "gender": "character’s gender - ‘male’, ‘female’, or ‘NA’ for narration",
            "alias": ["a list of aliases used for the character in the text"]
        }
    ]
}

The character name should be accurate enough, don't include some words that can refer to different characters like "少年" or "少女". Also, "narration" is not a character, don't include in the result.

I will provide the text for analysis in my next message. Please respond with only the complete JSON object, without any additional explanation or commentary.
